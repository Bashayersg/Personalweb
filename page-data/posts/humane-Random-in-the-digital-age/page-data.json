It wasn’t until recently, when I took on the role of Vice President at the GSDC, that I realized the hidden potential and valuable experiences within these opportunities.</p>\n<p>Here are some key benefits I’ve discovered:</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-relationships-and-connections\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#building-relationships-and-connections\" aria-label=\"building relationships and connections permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Building Relationships and Connections</h2>\n<p>Starting conversations outside your class circle can be tough. But stepping into the world of university clubs offers the unique opportunity to build meaningful and lasting relationships. You’ll find yourself surrounded by people who share your passion for programming, debate, robotics, or anything else you can imagine. Suddenly, you’re not just talking about the latest movie release; you’re discussing its historical context with a professor, collaborating on a robotics project with a senior student, or planning the next club event with a group of friends you just met. In my experience, I even had the opportunity to establish a personal connection with the dean of our college!</p>\n<p>In the end, you build a network that will last far beyond your college years, providing support, guidance, and friendships that enrich your life in countless ways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"developing-new-skills\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#developing-new-skills\" aria-label=\"developing new skills permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Developing New Skills</h2>\n<p>University clubs often engage in a variety of activities and projects, providing you with the chance to diversify your skill set beyond the confines of your academic major.
